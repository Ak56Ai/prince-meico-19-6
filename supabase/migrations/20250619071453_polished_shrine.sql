  # Fix User Profiles RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies on user_profiles table
    - Add new policies that allow authenticated users to manage their own profiles
    - Ensure users can insert, select, and update their own profile data

  2. Changes
    - Remove wallet_address-based JWT claim policies (incompatible with wallet auth)
    - Add simpler authenticated user policies for CRUD operations
    - Maintain data security while allowing proper functionality
